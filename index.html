  <center>Feet of the Elder Crow
sleet dusted once with snow
heat rarely keeps below
How have you fared, Oh winged sisters?

Flesh from her empty womb
fresh to an empty tomb
meshed ‘twixt weave and weft of loom
Spells best left uncast, Oh Dear Mister.

The Feet of the Elder Crow
Walking backward through the Snow
In a group we’re called “Murder,” you know.
How have you fared, Oh winged sisters?
